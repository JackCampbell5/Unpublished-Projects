## Fun Friends
Skills: Django, Python, Web Server, and Program Design 
In talking to people across the UMD campus, many people agree that it is much harder to meet people and make friends as everyone is always on their phones. To address this issue, I have been developing a chat application that connects users based on their responses to various questions.
Currently: 
+ User log-in is working
+ Chatting is working 
+ Matching is working 

Next Steps:
+ Enhance question quality for better matching 
+ Improve security measures to protect user data

* This project is yet to be released
